# Work-base Project - News Homepage

## Summary
For this project I have been tasked to create a homepage for a new news website. The website should follow the design guidelines that have been provided and must also feature a responsive design that will work on a range of different screen sizes. The guidelines state the typography that should be used, this includes which fonts should be used, the standard font size and the font weights which must be used. I must also make sure to follow the states which have been determined. This means making sure that the standard, hover and focus states all match the design guidelines. Before starting the website, I must plan the project by creating wireframes of the product and setup a timeline for the development. Once the development is completed, I will then deploy the site on Github pages.
